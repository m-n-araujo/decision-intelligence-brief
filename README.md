# Decision-Intelligence-Brief

# Decision Intelligence Brief (MVP)

Decision Intelligence Brief is a minimal viable product (MVP) web application that aggregates and visualizes recent research, news, and insights on organizational decision-making.

The goal of this prototype is to make emerging knowledge about decision science, AI, and governance easier to explore, connect, and understand in a structured and human-readable way.

# Purpose

This application was created as an experimental MVP to:

- Curate recent studies and news related to decision intelligence
- Provide a simple, visual interface for exploring topics and trends
- Allow users to identify conceptual connections between articles
- Validate product and UX assumptions before a full platform build
- This version is intentionally lightweight and designed for early validation and iteration.

# MVP Scope

This repository contains a single-file static web application built with:

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

Current capabilities include:
- Topic clustering and filtering
- Time-based news discovery
- Bookmarking (local storage)
- User-defined article connections (local graph logic)
- Source attribution and outbound links
- No backend, database, or authentication is included in this version.
